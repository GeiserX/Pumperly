// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Which source supplies Spain's EV chargers
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Spain has two: OpenChargeMap (`EV_ES`, crowdsourced, every country) and Mapa
// REVE (`EV_ES_REVE`, the official registry every Spanish CPO files into).
//
// They must never both run. 92% of REVE locations sit within 50m of an existing
// OpenChargeMap row, so running both double-pins ~13k Spanish chargers — and
// once REVE has retired those rows (see scrapers/reve.ts), a single stray run of
// the OpenChargeMap scraper would put all ~19k of them straight back.
//
// This rule is needed by both the scheduler (instrumentation-node.ts) and the manual
// CLI (scrapers/cli.ts), so it lives here rather than in either of them. Two
// copies would drift, and the way it drifts is silent: the map just quietly
// fills up with duplicates again.
